This project focuses on analyzing how technology can be applied to improve the performance, 
efficiency, and effectiveness of training in a gym environment and to design/develop a system that 
will implement science-based expertise and knowledge in helping individuals to transform their 
strength, fitness, and physique. The project is aimed at finding solutions for overcoming ambiguous 
and misleading concepts in the fitness industry as well as uncertainty regarding training methods 
that cause many gym members, especially the more inexperienced ones to commit a series of 
mistakes at the gym resulting in poor performance, injuries, and inefficiency in achieving their goals. 
Effective solutions to this problem will ensure an efficient, well-balanced, injury-free workout 
experience. It will help people to achieve their gym goals and keep them motivated throughout their 
journey.
A major area of interest for this project will be focused on motivating the users to complete 
workouts, areas such as new emerging technologies are analyzed in order to achieve this goal. 
Enhanced user experience and convenience of use are some of the major factors for the 
successfulness of the system, this project aims to test different methodologies of assisting 
individuals at training and identify the most suitable to be implemented. The project will document 
the entire process starting from the research conducted to analyze and get insights into how people 
are currently training and identifying opportunities for technology, to the requirements gathering 
and designing and developments of the system.
