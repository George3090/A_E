The project is aimed in researching how technology can be used to improve efficiency of training at 
the gym and implement that knowledge into an android application that will be used by gym 
members. The application is intended to help individuals with different levels of expertise in training
by providing a clear comprehensive workout plan that will include instruction on how to perform 
exercises and should allow users to track their performance(number of reps, weights lifted etc). 
A major area of interest for this project will be focused on motivating the users to complete 
workouts, as one of the major motives of training is the wish for a specific physique that reflects the 
contemporary aesthetics ideals[1,2,3,4] the application is aimed at creating a game like experience 
where the user creates an Avatar based on his physiques, he/she will then set specific goals (eg. 
building muscle, losing weight). The avatar will consist of a graphic which will try to reflect the user 
physiques, it will be created based on the user physical characteristics (height, weight, body fat, 
shoulder length, waist girth etc.).The user will then set a target for example building muscles, and an 
avatar with the desired body characteristics will be created as “Target”. Every month the user will 
update their avatar based on their achievements. The user will be able to visualize their progress to
that specific target therefore ensuring a clear understanding of results. 
The application will provide relevant workout plans based on the user goals. The workout plans will 
consist of comprehensive instruction on how to perform the exercises and will track the user 
performance. The program should allow conveniency when used at the gym, a major must for the 
application is to create an innovative human computer interaction method. For this I am planning to 
use smart watches to make it easier to track number of reps and rest time. This should be an 
innovative and stress-free experience for the users especially for less experienced gym members.
Also, a full database with all types of exercises categorised by muscle groups with relevant 
instruction should be included to allow user to customize their workout plans. 
The project is aimed in overcoming ambiguous and misleading concepts as well as uncertainty 
regarding training methods that causes many gym members especially the more unexperienced 
ones to commit a series of mistakes at the gym resulting in poor performance, injuries and 
inefficiency in achieving their goals. Effective solutions to this problem will ensure an efficient, well 
balanced, injury free workout experience. It will help people to achieve their gym goals and keep 
them motivate throughout their journey.
Project Aims and Objectives:
• Identify design solution for a mobile application in implementing expertise/ knowledge in 
the fitness sector into a platform
• Create a convenient way of representing workout plans and allow user to track performance
• Create a smart watch version of the application to increase convenience 
• Make progress at the gym measurable
• Improve user’s motivation in achieving their targets
• Evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented solutions in a real-world 
environment
